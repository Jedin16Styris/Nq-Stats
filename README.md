# NQ Historical Insights – 10-Year Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing **10 years of Nasdaq Futures (NQ)** daily data to uncover meaningful **patterns, probabilities, and insights** for traders and analysts.  

The inspiration for this project came from Chris, a Twitter influencer who performed a deep analysis of **15 years of NQ data** and shared valuable insights that help navigate uncertain markets.  
You can also check out his dedicated page for NQ stats here: **[NQ Stats](https://nqstats.com/)**.

## **Project Overview**
- **Data Source:** MarketWatch (10 years of daily NQ data)  
- **Framework:** Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy)  
- **Timeframe Analyzed:** Daily candles (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)  
- **Goal:** To extract **statistical patterns, probabilities, and behavioral metrics** from historical NQ data to improve market understanding and decision-making.

## **What’s Included**
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation** – Handling missing values, ensuring proper date indexing.  
2. **Core Metrics & Insights:**  
   - Average Daily Ranges & Volatility  
   - Probability of Sweeps (Previous Highs/Lows)  
   - Gap Analysis (Gap Size, Gap Fill Probabilities)  
   - Inside/Outside Day Frequencies  
   - Day-of-Week & Monthly Seasonal Patterns  
   - Streak Analysis (Consecutive Up/Down Days)  
3. **Visualizations** – Histograms, heatmaps, and line charts for quick interpretation.

## **Why This Matters**
These insights help traders understand **how NQ behaves** on a daily basis, making it easier to:  
- Anticipate likely daily expansions.  
- Spot seasonality or day-of-week tendencies.  
- Manage risk with volatility-adjusted strategies.  
- **Make informed trading decisions and avoid confusion in directional bias.**  

This project is designed to **convert raw data into actionable knowledge** for tackling uncertain market conditions.

## **Future Plans**
- Adding **more advanced metrics** (weekly bias probabilities, conditional expansions, volatility clustering).  
- Integrating **machine learning** for pattern recognition and forecasting.  
- Building an **interactive dashboard** for real-time exploration of these statistics.
